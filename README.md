# Link-in-Bio-for-Instagram
A free version of linkin.bio for organizations to attach links to instagram posts. Groups may use this code to set up a website which mimics linkin.bio. 

## Usage

1. Create a super user
2. Visit /login and enter credentials
3. Visit /create-post to create a new post
4. Visit / to view all posts so far.

## Motivation

The application has currently been built for a student organization at IIIT Hyderabad - Ping! but could easily be modified for other purposes.
